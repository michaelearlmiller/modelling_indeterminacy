# modelling_indeterminacy
files for simulating indeterminacy in newtonian gravitation  

# questions to answer
* indeterminacy in fundamental constants  
   * change gravitational constant before limit on measurement precision
   * change gravitational constant after limit on measurement precision
* indeterminacy in parameters (masses)  
   * find value of d_W which does make a difference in orbits
   * find value of d_W which doesn't make a different in orbits
   * find the boundary 
* indeterminacy in initial data  

# tasks
* write a function that randomizes digits of a quantity after d_W  
* find literature on numerical errors in nbody simulations
